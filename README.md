# Simrunner

Simrunner is the Pythonic way of executing asynchronous simulations, completely replacing the traditional Batch Scripts. Modern workflows call for modern tools, by addopting Python and Jupyter Notebooks for simulation execuation; advanced data pipelines can be developed, and robust analysis and reporting can be undertaken all within the same environment.

It is hoped that this package will seed the shift of the water resource industry into these modern tools.

## Installation

A prelease version is not available on PyPi, so to use:

Download the the code, either clone or from zip. Then either;
- Copy the content of the [src directory](https://github.com/norman-tom/simrunner/tree/main/src) into your project directory and use the run.ipynb as the template. or,
- Manually install locally using pip, [instruction](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-from-a-local-src-tree).

## Usage

The functionality of the package has been detailed in the [run.ipynb](https://github.com/norman-tom/simrunner/blob/main/src/run.ipynb). It is best to use this notebook as a template to get started.  

The intended use of this package is to move all data pipelines, analysis and reporting under one roof (Jupyter). This will allow documentation of decisions along side analysis, and automatic reporting of results, something that is impossible with Batch Scripting. 

The library can also be used in python scripts if you are not wanting to use Jupyter.
