# Modelrunner

Modelrunner is the Pythonic way of executing asynchronous simulations, completely replacing the traditional Batch Scripts. Modern workflows call for modern tools, by addopting Python and Jupyter Notebooks for simulation execuation; advanced data pipelines can be developed, and robust analysis and reporting can be undertaken all within the same environment.

It is hoped that this package will seed the shift of the water resource industry into these modern tools.

## Installation

This package is not yet hosted on pip. To install, download the scr directory and use run.ipynb or run.py as the starting template. The content of the src folder can be copied (in its entirety) to any folder which is intended to be to root of the project.

## Usage

The functionality of the package has been detailed in the run.ipynb and run.py. 

The intended use of this package is to move all data pipelines, analysis and reporting under one roof (Jupyter). This will allow documentation of decisions along side analysis, and automatic reporting of results, something that is impossible with Batch Scripting.
