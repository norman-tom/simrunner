# Google Style Python Docstrings

This document describes the Google Style Python Docstrings, which is a set of conventions for writing documentation.

## Comments and Docstrings

Be sure to use the right style for module, function, method docstrings and inline comments.

### Docstrings

Python uses docstrings to document code. A docstring is a string that is the first statement in a package, module, class or function. These strings can be extracted automatically through the `__doc__` member of the object and are used by pydoc. (Try running pydoc on your module to see how it looks.) Always use the three-double-quote `"""` format for docstrings (per PEP 257). A docstring should be organised as a summary line (one physical line not exceeding 80 characters) terminated by a period, question mark, or exclamation point. When writing more (encouraged), this must be followed by a blank line, followed by the rest of the docstring starting at the same cursor position as the first quote of the first line. There are more formatting guidelines for docstrings below.

### Modules

Every file should contain licence boilerplate. Choose the appropriate boilerplate for the licence used by the project (for example, Apache 2.0, BSD, LGPL, GPL).

Files should start with a docstring describing the contents and usage of the module.

```python
"""A one-line summary of the module or program, terminated by a period.

Leave one blank line.  The rest of this docstring should contain an
overall description of the module or program.  Optionally, it may also
contain a brief description of exported classes and functions and/or usage
examples.

Typical usage example:

  foo = ClassFoo()
  bar = foo.function_bar()
"""
```

#### Test modules

Module-level docstrings for test files are not required. They should be included only when there is additional information that can be provided.

Examples include some specifics on how the test should be run, an explanation of an unusual setup pattern, dependency on the external environment, and so on.

```python
"""This blaze test uses golden files.

You can update those files by running
`blaze run //foo/bar:foo_test -- --update_golden_files` from the `google3`
directory.
"""
```

Docstrings that do not provide any new information should not be used.

```python
"""Tests for foo.bar."""
```

### Functions and Methods

In this section, "function" means a method, function, generator, or property.

A docstring is mandatory for every function that has one or more of the following properties:

- being part of the public API
- nontrivial size
- non-obvious logic

A docstring should give enough information to write a call to the function without reading the function's code. The docstring should describe the function's calling syntax and its semantics, but generally not its implementation details, unless those details are relevant to how the function is to be used. For example, a function that mutates one of its arguments as a side effect should note that in its docstring. Otherwise, subtle but important details of a function's implementation that are not relevant to the caller are better expressed as comments alongside the code than within the function's docstring.

The docstring may be descriptive-style (`"""Fetches rows from a Bigtable."""`) or imperative-style (`"""Fetch rows from a Bigtable."""`), but the style should be consistent within a file. The docstring for a `@property` data descriptor should use the same style as the docstring for an attribute or a function argument (`"""The Bigtable path."""`, rather than `"""Returns the Bigtable path."""`).

Certain aspects of a function should be documented in special sections, listed below. Each section begins with a heading line, which ends with a colon. All sections other than the heading should maintain a hanging indent of two or four spaces (be consistent within a file). These sections can be omitted in cases where the function's name and signature are informative enough that it can be aptly described using a one-line docstring.

**Args:**
List each parameter by name. A description should follow the name, and be separated by a colon followed by either a space or newline. If the description is too long to fit on a single 80-character line, use a hanging indent of 2 or 4 spaces more than the parameter name (be consistent with the rest of the docstrings in the file). The description should include required type(s) if the code does not contain a corresponding type annotation. If a function accepts `*foo` (variable length argument lists) and/or `**bar` (arbitrary keyword arguments), they should be listed as `*foo` and `**bar`.

**Returns:** (or **Yields:** for generators)
Describe the semantics of the return value, including any type information that the type annotation does not provide. If the function only returns None, this section is not required. It may also be omitted if the docstring starts with "Return", "Returns", "Yield", or "Yields" (e.g. `"""Returns row from Bigtable as a tuple of strings."""`) and the opening sentence is sufficient to describe the return value. Do not imitate older 'NumPy style' (example), which frequently documented a tuple return value as if it were multiple return values with individual names (never mentioning the tuple). Instead, describe such a return value as: "Returns: A tuple (mat_a, mat_b), where mat_a is …, and …". The auxiliary names in the docstring need not necessarily correspond to any internal names used in the function body (as those are not part of the API). If the function uses yield (is a generator), the Yields: section should document the object returned by next(), instead of the generator object itself that the call evaluates to.

**Raises:**
List all exceptions that are relevant to the interface followed by a description. Use a similar exception name + colon + space or newline and hanging indent style as described in Args:. You should not document exceptions that get raised if the API specified in the docstring is violated (because this would paradoxically make behaviour under violation of the API part of the API).

```python
def fetch_smalltable_rows(
    table_handle: smalltable.Table,
    keys: Sequence[bytes | str],
    require_all_keys: bool = False,
) -> Mapping[bytes, tuple[str, ...]]:
    """Fetches rows from a Smalltable.

    Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance
    represented by table_handle.  String keys will be UTF-8 encoded.

    Args:
        table_handle: An open smalltable.Table instance.
        keys: A sequence of strings representing the key of each table
          row to fetch.  String keys will be UTF-8 encoded.
        require_all_keys: If True only rows with values set for all keys will be
          returned.

    Returns:
        A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
        fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
        example:

        {b'Serak': ('Rigel VII', 'Preparer'),
         b'Zim': ('Irk', 'Invader'),
         b'Lrrr': ('Omicron Persei 8', 'Emperor')}

        Returned keys are always bytes.  If a key from the keys argument is
        missing from the dictionary, then that row was not found in the
        table (and require_all_keys must have been False).

    Raises:
        IOError: An error occurred accessing the smalltable.
    """
```

Similarly, this variation on Args: with a line break is also allowed:

```python
def fetch_smalltable_rows(
    table_handle: smalltable.Table,
    keys: Sequence[bytes | str],
    require_all_keys: bool = False,
) -> Mapping[bytes, tuple[str, ...]]:
    """Fetches rows from a Smalltable.

    Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance
    represented by table_handle.  String keys will be UTF-8 encoded.

    Args:
      table_handle:
        An open smalltable.Table instance.
      keys:
        A sequence of strings representing the key of each table row to
        fetch.  String keys will be UTF-8 encoded.
      require_all_keys:
        If True only rows with values set for all keys will be returned.

    Returns:
      A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
      fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
      example:

      {b'Serak': ('Rigel VII', 'Preparer'),
       b'Zim': ('Irk', 'Invader'),
       b'Lrrr': ('Omicron Persei 8', 'Emperor')}

      Returned keys are always bytes.  If a key from the keys argument is
      missing from the dictionary, then that row was not found in the
      table (and require_all_keys must have been False).

    Raises:
      IOError: An error occurred accessing the smalltable.
    """
```

#### Overridden Methods

A method that overrides a method from a base class does not need a docstring if it is explicitly decorated with `@override` (from typing_extensions or typing modules), unless the overriding method's behaviour materially refines the base method's contract, or details need to be provided (e.g., documenting additional side effects), in which case a docstring with at least those differences is required on the overriding method.

```python
from typing_extensions import override

class Parent:
  def do_something(self):
    """Parent method, includes docstring."""

# Child class, method annotated with override.
class Child(Parent):
  @override
  def do_something(self):
    pass

# Child class, but without @override decorator, a docstring is required.
class Child(Parent):
  def do_something(self):
    pass

# Docstring is trivial, @override is sufficient to indicate that docs can be
# found in the base class.
class Child(Parent):
  @override
  def do_something(self):
    """See base class."""
```

### Classes

Classes should have a docstring below the class definition describing the class. Public attributes, excluding properties, should be documented here in an Attributes section and follow the same formatting as a function's Args section.

```python
class SampleClass:
    """Summary of class here.

    Longer class information...
    Longer class information...

    Attributes:
        likes_spam: A boolean indicating if we like SPAM or not.
        eggs: An integer count of the eggs we have laid.
    """

    def __init__(self, likes_spam: bool = False):
        """Initialises the instance based on spam preference.

        Args:
          likes_spam: Defines if instance exhibits this preference.
        """
        self.likes_spam = likes_spam
        self.eggs = 0

    @property
    def butter_sticks(self) -> int:
        """The number of butter sticks we have."""
```

All class docstrings should start with a one-line summary that describes what the class instance represents. This implies that subclasses of Exception should also describe what the exception represents, and not the context in which it might occur. The class docstring should not repeat unnecessary information, such as that the class is a class.

**Yes:**
```python
class CheeseShopAddress:
  """The address of a cheese shop.

  ...
  """

class OutOfCheeseError(Exception):
  """No more cheese is available."""
```

**No:**
```python
class CheeseShopAddress:
  """Class that describes the address of a cheese shop.

  ...
  """

class OutOfCheeseError(Exception):
  """Raised when no more cheese is available."""
```

### Block and Inline Comments

The final place to have comments is in tricky parts of the code. If you're going to have to explain it at the next code review, you should comment it now. Complicated operations get a few lines of comments before the operations commence. Non-obvious ones get comments at the end of the line.

```python
# We use a weighted dictionary search to find out where i is in
# the array.  We extrapolate position based on the largest num
# in the array and the array size and then do binary search to
# get the exact number.

if i & (i-1) == 0:  # True if i is 0 or a power of 2.
```

To improve legibility, these comments should start at least 2 spaces away from the code with the comment character `#`, followed by at least one space before the text of the comment itself.

On the other hand, never describe the code. Assume the person reading the code knows Python (though not what you're trying to do) better than you do.

**BAD COMMENT:** Now go through the b array and make sure whenever i occurs the next element is i+1

### Punctuation, Spelling, and Grammar

Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar; it is easier to read well-written comments than badly written ones.

Comments should be as readable as narrative text, with proper capitalisation and punctuation. In many cases, complete sentences are more readable than sentence fragments. Shorter comments, such as comments at the end of a line of code, can sometimes be less formal, but you should be consistent with your style.

Although it can be frustrating to have a code reviewer point out that you are using a comma when you should be using a semicolon, it is very important that source code maintain a high level of clarity and readability. Proper punctuation, spelling, and grammar help with that goal.
